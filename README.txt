Simple Python Search Spider, Page Ranker, and Visualizer

This is a set of programs that emulate some of the functions of a 
search engine.  They store their data in a SQLITE3 database named
'spider.sqlite'.  This file can be removed at any time to restart the
process.   

You should install the SQLite browser to view and modify 
the databases from:

http://sqlitebrowser.org/

This program crawls a web site and pulls a series of pages into the
database, recording the links between pages.

in the console so for each console window you open, you may need
to type the following command before running this code:
